# TV Central

The ​ TV Central ​ app aims to aide the TV show enthusiast in keeping track of what’s new on
television, what’s popular and what’s currently airing. The user can view more information about
each show listed, from synopsis, episode information, similar shows, content ratings, images,
acting credits to videos. All TV show data in TV Central will be provided by ​ TMDB ​ ’s extensive
API. The ​ TV Central ​ app is a ground-up inspiration of ​ Upnext TV Series Manager ​ which I built
before exposure to Udacity’s Android Developer Nanodegree program. ​ TV Central aims ​ to
improve on ​ Upnext ​ ’s lacking elements such as UI (proper implementation of Material Design for
both phones and tablets), data, and efficient background syncing.
